# Multi-Pokémon Framework
Multi-Pokémon Framework is a plugin developed by Jared0714 that is based off of Nanquitas' CTRPluginFramework. It supports both the 6th and 7th generations of the Nintendo 3DS Pokémon games. This plugin is a work in progress as well as a learning exercise.

## Installation
After installing the .zip file, copy and paste the contents inside to the root of your SD card. After booting into Luma3DS, open up the Rosalina menu by pressing L + Down + Select, and scroll down to Plugin Loader and press A to enable it. This only needs to be done once. After that, simply start the game. A blue flash on the top screen indicates that the plugin was found and loaded, and in order to open up the plugin menu, press Select.

## Preview
Coming soon!

Most of these codes has been derived from a code database (majority of them being created by ymyn), which then gets written in C++ and put into a plugin by Jared0714. A huge thanks to AnalogMan151 and Hartie95 for their support and references, as well as H4x0rSpooky for their profoundness and contribution. I would also like to thank Lukas for their consistent help throughout.
