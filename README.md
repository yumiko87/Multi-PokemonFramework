# Multi-Pokémon Framework
Multi-Pokémon Framework is a plugin developed by [Jared0714](https://github.com/Jared0714) that is based off of [Nanquitas](https://github.com/Nanquitas/)' CTRPluginFramework. It supports both the 6th and 7th generations of the Nintendo 3DS Pokémon games. This plugin is a work in progress as well as a learning exercise.

## Installation
After installing the .zip file, copy and paste the contents inside to the root of your SD card. After booting into Luma3DS, open up the Rosalina menu by pressing L + Down + Select, and scroll down to Plugin Loader and press A to enable it. This only needs to be done once. After that, simply start the game. A blue flash on the top screen indicates that the plugin was found and loaded, and in order to open up the plugin menu, press Select.

## Preview

## Note
Most of these codes have been derived from a code database, majority of them being created by ymyn, which then gets written in C++ and put into a plugin by Jared0714.
